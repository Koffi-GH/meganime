MEGANIME STORE v1.0 - DJANGO PROJECT

Meganime is a basic website that allows a user to browse through a collection of manga/anime-related products.
While no actual purchases can be made, the intent is to have everything that precedes the purchase be possible.


Before running the development server, navigate to "../online_store" in the meganime directory.


Things to be worked on in next version:
	- Improving shipping and total cost pricing algorithm to avoid using text editing
	- Adding log in functionality
	- Adding product filtering and sorting functionality
	- Adding text blurbs for products
	- Adding 'no items in cart' to cart page if no items have been added to cart
	- Improving "featured items" selection on home page (work on the randomizer)
	- "Featured items" should not change when adding an item to cart (work on randomizer)
	- Adding extra parameter in cart.js so that more than 1 quantity of any item can be added to the cart at once (on individual product page)
	-Adding more products(?)
	- UI improvements
